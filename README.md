Fake News Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This repository contains code for predicting fake news articles using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify news articles as either fake or real based on their content and features extracted from the text.

Dataset
We used a publicly available dataset consisting of labeled news articles. The dataset contains features such as article text, title, author, publication date, and labels indicating whether the article is fake or real. Please refer to the dataset documentation for more details.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train the machine learning models and evaluate their performance accurately.

Methods and Techniques
We employed various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate the models for fake news prediction. Some of the techniques used include:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, removing stop words)
Feature extraction (TF-IDF, word embeddings)
Model selection (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.)
Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
Usage
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, etc.)
